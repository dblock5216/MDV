<p>I chose to theme this weeks assignment around my experiences going through basic training.</p>
<p>My theme for the most part is transparent and easy to follow.  I wanted to keep it as simple as possible </p>
<p>Osut stands for "one station unit training".  Its meant to consolidate basic combat training and actual mos(job) training all in one shot.  Usually the jobs that require constant output of bodies are used in this program(combat arms)</p>
